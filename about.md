<h1>About me</h1>

I'm Mark Strendin, and I do software development and all things cybersecurity for Living Sky School Division No. 202 in Saskatchewan, Canada.

My [main website](https://markstrendin.ca) serves as a link to all of the places that I post stuff. I _do not_ typically post on social media.
